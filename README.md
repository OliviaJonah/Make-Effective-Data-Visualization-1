# Make Effective Data Visualization

## Feedback

### First version

Feedback A:
> I think narrative makes sense. It is clear you want to show that left-handed are
somewhat better at average. In my view you need title for the y-axis and red
line of a median is not very distinctive on a black box background on my screen.
Also, should there be some comparison of means? Just a thought.

Feedback B:
> I like your visualization.  I think the narrative is supported by the data.  My
only suggestion, visually, would be to re-order the columns with the left on the
left, switch hitters in the middle and right handers on the right. Perhaps it
would also  help to color code each of those populations and maintain those
colors throughout all of your charts. Very interesting data.  I had a feeling
that the % of left handed players was higher than that of the general
population, but had no idea that they had a higher avg batting average & HRs.

Feedback C:
>I think your visualization and story is very clear. Just two cents, I would
suggest rescale the y-axis of the last graph to the range between 0 and 250,
which would be more clear for the reader to see the difference between the
categories. I might also consider flip the axises of the first graph and enlarge
the categorical name for all and make it easier for user to read.

Feedback D:
>like your narration in general. Especially liked the way you give info for
non-baseball fans as well and end up with intriguing findings on why baseball
may be rigged for lefties! This being a explanatory visualization (as opposed to
exploratory) you may want to cut down on some stat lingo and showing stat heavy
box charts which require good amount of explanation to a non-stat person. On
visual front, I would suggest to use some color and find some way to bring these
charts together where reader can drill down themselves. May be a bubble chart
with home runs and batting average as its axis with color coding for handiness
might give visual clues to reader that left handers are better performers.ï»¿

Feedback E:
>Overall I find your visualization to be very understandable.  I agree with
lekhraj that boxplots might not be the best chart type to use, as they aren't
very understandable for the general public.  If you do decide to use them, I
would suggest cutting down on stat lingo and focus on the conclusion. Also, for
the boxplots it would be nice to be able to hover over and see the means.  You
could use the scatterplot like lakhraj suggested, or bar charts with ranges like
this:

Hope that was helpful.
